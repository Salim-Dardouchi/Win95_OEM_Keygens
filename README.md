# Win95 OEM Keygens
A collection of my Win95 keygens.. It's kind of my own "Hello World", something I do to get used to a new programming language

# How is a Win95 OEM key made ?
```
DDDYY-OEM-MOD7KEY-UNCHK
DDD - Day of the year (0-366) (you can use 366 even if you're not on a leap year)
YY  - Year (95 to 02)
OEM - OEM String
MOD7KEY - 7 numbers. The first pair has to be 00 and then you can have any number as long as you can divide the sum by 7
UNCHK - Unchecked. Literally, you can put any number there and it'll just work...
```
